            This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Aircraft
            Structure in aerospace engineering, focusing on the fundamentals of
            structural members, failure estimation, composite materials, and
            finite element modeling (FEM). Over a series of weekend sessions,
            participants will learn to analyze structural behavior, identify and
            predict failures, and understand key considerations in composite
            design. The course also covers aircraft-specific structures,
            providing practical insights into material applications and load
            distribution essential for aerospace design.
